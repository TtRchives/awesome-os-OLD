# The List
- [Elive](https://elivecd.org)  
**Elive** is a very lightweight and beautiful OS. It is my daily driver and I highly recommend it to all. But if Enlightenment isn't your cup of tea...
- [theShell OS](https://vicr123.com/theshell/os/)  
OK, it's discontinued, but it is pretty good-looking. If you want a continued OS just use [Arch](https://www.archlinux.org/) and install [theShell](https://vicr123.com/theshell).
