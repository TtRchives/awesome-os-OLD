# Contributing -- Read this first!
Here are the steps for contributing :

1. **Provide a website.** There's nothing worse than hearing about a great OS but not being able to find it! If there isn't a website anymore link to a [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org) link. If there isn't a website at all link to the SourceForge or whatever download link.
1. **Provide a short description.** Why should I download this new novelty OS? Explain to us!
1. **Make a PR.** So that people can view it at the direct **awesome-os** repo.
